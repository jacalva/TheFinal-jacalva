Final Project Objective.

Starfall Regime Enterprises is a prominent game industry publisher seeking to enhance its profitability by identifying and addressing underperforming development studios. To achieve this, they require the creation of a database system that tracks studio performance based on game sales. The goal is to pinpoint which studio is generating the weakest sales, enabling more targeted interventions to improve overall performance.
Your task is to design and develop a webpage that can both display and categorize each development studio and its respective games. The system should allow the publisher to:

⦁	Add new games
⦁	Edit existing game details
⦁	Sort games based on various criteria
⦁	Search for specific games by title or other relevant parameters

Additionally, the project should include  an overview of the total number of copies sold for each studio, allowing the publisher to quickly assess overall studio performance.
